# Roulette

## Overview
The casino game featuring a wheel of numbers where you have to predict where the ball will land.

## Description
View the website [here](https://miknsj.github.io/roulette).

## Notes
Unlike previous websites that I have built, this will be mostly created using JavaScript only.

<br>

Also, the responsive/adaptive design will not be fully enforced. This means that the website may not render properly on
smaller devices. For the BEST viewing purposes, I recommend loading the website on a device with at least the screen
size of a laptop.
