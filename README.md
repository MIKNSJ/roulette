## Notes
Unlike previous websites that I have built, this will be mostly created using JavaScript only.

<br>

Also, the responsive/adaptive design will not be fully enforced. This means that the website may not render properly on
smaller devices. For the BEST viewing purposes, I recommend loading the website on a device with at least the screen
size of 1300px.
